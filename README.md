You are currently looking at my Project Repository College Management. My application has two types of users.
  1. Admin user (existing user)
  2. Student user
  
Admin user is authorized to add new student and provide he/she with a username and password. Also he can add/update new courses offered in the college, search for a student, edit student details and soft delete if the student is not active in any course.

Where as student at any time can login and look at his/her corresponding information like Fistname, Lastname, Course, Address and Grades.

I have developed two versions of add, edit, delete in my project.
 1. using thymelefe templates.
 2. using DataTables.

Where my DataTables version currently expired lack of license, which I have developed in term of 15 days free trail.
